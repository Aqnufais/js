variable
variable is a container used to store data values that can be reused or changed later in the code. You can declare variables using var, let and const

var -> function-scoped and was used in older javascript versions

let -> block-scoped and allows reassignment it is used in modern javascript

const -> block-scoped but cannot be reassigned it is used for values that shouldnt changed

const accountId = '12345'
let accountPassowrd = "1234"
var emailId = "aqnufais45@me.com"

// accountId = '2345' // cannot be reassigned

// accountPassowrd = '6789' // let allows reassignment

console.table([accountId, accountPassowrd, emailId])
